# breastCancerML-RandomForest
A Random Forest Machine Learning model created from the breast cancer data set directly imported from the Python package Scikit-Learn and SoloLearn's Machine Learning curriculum.
The Python packages used in this project include NumPy, pandas, and Scikit-learn.
The NumPy package is used to create arrays of data values and features a whole array of arithmetic operations and functions to perform on such data.
The pandas package allows for the cleaning and organization of data into DataFrame structures and series.
Scikit-learn is a package that allows for the performance of machine learning models on the data.

In this project, the model chosen was the Random Forest model.
Learning was supervised learning based off Scikit-Learn's breast_cancer data set.

A copy of the code was done in Google Colaboratory, with the file also attached to this repository.

An elbow graph was created to visualize and optimize between the random forest model's performance and complexity.
The elbow graph visualized was also utilized towards the tuning of the random forest model.
Feature selection was also performed to further tune the random forest model.
